Homework #1

Assumptions:
Number of Floors: 7
Maximum Capacity: 10
Sweep algorithm
The elevator is bi-directional (no sideways elevators)
The only 2 ways an elevator can be made to stop at a floor is to have a passenger destined for that floor and be called to it. 

The Elevator class has 3 properties. 
current_floor and going_up are self-explantory.
passenger_targets keeps a list of all destinations for passengers, including passengers who have called. 
If a passenger is heading for a floor X, passenger_target[X] is incremented once for them. 
If a passenger is heading for floor X and another passenger calls an elevator on that floor, nothing happens.
If no passenger is heading for floor X and the Elevator is called for X, passenger_target[x] is set to -1. 
If passenger_target[current_floor] is anything but 0, stop and let passengers on and off.

The class contains a main method for testing purposes.
